1.  Introduction

The file README is referring to the original DWB 3.3 release from 1993  and  is
kept  unchanged since then.  Parts of it's contents may be outdated.  For this
reason all up-to-date install and usage information can be found in this file.


2.  Download

The source code can be downloaded as a zip archive  with  the  "Download  ZIP"
button on

  https://github.com/n-t-roff/DWB3.3

or with the git command

  $ git clone https://github.com/n-t-roff/DWB3.3.git

A git repository can be kept up-to-date with

  $ git pull


3.  Installation

For configuration the file dwb.mk can be  modified,  although  reasonable  de-
faults have already been set.  Default installation directory is

  /usr/local/dwb

which must (for usage after  installation)  be  set  as  environment  variable
DWBHOME.   $DWBHOME/bin  needs to be added to the PATH variable.  For e.g. the
bourne shell this can be done with

  $ DWBHOME=/usr/local/dwb; export DWBHOME
  $ PATH=$DWBHOME/bin:$PATH; export PATH

The manual pages are installed to

  /usr/local/dwb/man/man1  and
  /usr/local/dwb/man/man5

Other settings should only be changed if really necessary.  E.g. the variable

  SYSTEM=BSD4_2

must be left unchanged regardless of the OS.

A configure script had been added to make the software  compile  on  different
operating systems.  This must be run first:

  $ ./configure

The software is build with

  $ make

and installed with

  # make install

After installation locally build data is cleaned up with

  $ make clobber

If there are problems questions can be send to

  troff [at] arcor [dot] de

and issues can be reported at

  https://github.com/n-t-roff/DWB3.3/issues


4.  Note on using nroff for displaying man pages

The default output device of nroff is the TELETYPE Model 37.  If  that  output
is  piped  to more(1) or less(1) some control codes can't be interpreted which
results in wrong display of man pages.  For a correct presentation the  output
should be piped through col(1):

  $ tbl <filename> | nroff -man | col -x | less

Note that DWB is of limited use for viewing today's manual pages.  mdoc(7) had
not  been available when DWB 3.3 was released so this macro package is not in-
cluded.  Well written manual pages using man(7) usually should work  but  some
(e.g.  generated  from  other  languages)  are using special groff(1) features
which are not available in DWB.  On the other hand many DWB manual  pages  are
only  formated  correctly by DWB itself since there are some DWB extensions in
it's man macros.  groff(1), Heirloom nroff, or mandoc(1) should not be used to
view DWB manual pages.

5.2  Tested components

Not all tools and macro packages had been tested yet.  Partly because they are
not  important anymore or because of lack of input files or just because there
had not been time for it yet.  The following list gives an overview.  If there
